READ ME - Alien Fury

Game Concept:
A 3D endless runner where the player character runs in place while obstacles approach. The parallax background moves opposite to the running direction to create movement illusion. The game includes 3 Levels, where the player has to avoid 6 collisions in each level to reach the next level.

Implemented Requirements:

1. 3D Model & Animations:
   - Loaded MD2 model with run and jump animations
   - Run animation plays continuously
   - Jump animation triggers on UP key press

2. Parallax System:
   - Multi-layer parallax background
   - Moves opposite to player's running direction
   - Different speeds for depth illusion

3. Obstacle System:
   - Randomly generated 3D objects (spheres)
   - Move towards player at increasing speed
   - Disappear on collision or when avoided
   - Collision detection using distance checks

4. Game Progression:
   - 3 levels with increasing difficulty
   - Level completes after avoiding 6 objects
   - Visual and audio feedback for collisions

5. UI System:
   - Landing page with game title
   - Main menu (New Game, Help, Exit)
   - Pause menu during gameplay
   - Help page with instructions
   - Exit confirmation dialog

Technical Approach:

- Used OpenGL for 3D rendering
- Implemented MD2 model loader for character
- Created texture-based parallax backgrounds
- Timer-based obstacle spawning system
- State machine for game flow control
- Sound effects for key actions
- Collision detection via radius checks

Controls:
- UP: Jump
- RIGHT: Moves towards right
- P: Pause game
	- R: Resume
	- M: Main Menu
	- E: Exit Window
- ESC: exit game abruptly

Assets Used:
- 3D character model (MD2 format)
- Multiple background textures
- spheres with texture for obstacles
- Sound effects for jump/collision
- Background music

Development Notes:
- Focused on smooth animation transitions
- No difficulty progression, visual differences only
- Implemented responsive controls
