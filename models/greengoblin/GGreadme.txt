I made this model by adding to the male model.  Duh!
I was my first try, gonna start an original one not that i know that i can, hehe.  It was made with
Quake 2 Model Editor v0.83.  

If you dont know how to install it then check the read me that came with some other model that 
you inevidably downloaded and roughly follow those.

The Green Goblin skin was made by Raven, with much thanks for the inspiration. 
I have since turned that into the hobgoblin skin included, with thanks to Warped for the cool icon.

This model was created with the Superheros mod in mind.  Thanks to the Mod Squad, we all have a really cool
, fun bitchin' way to play Quake 2.  It would best be used with the flying power and maybe proximity mines or grenade swarm.

Enjoy. 

Oddjob

P.S.  If anybody wants to make a skin for this, there is a slight bug in the skin mesh, due to the fact that the hat was added 
to the model.  So the hat is colored by a single pixel located on the front right shin near the top.  My advice.. Use nst to paint directly on the model.
