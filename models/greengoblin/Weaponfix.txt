DESCRIPTION:
------------
 This is a Fix to all those Models that Gives you a 'NULL SKIN ERROR..' when
played in a Quake2 game. It's just a face (3 vertexes..) that is linked to the 
male weapon skin. Basically it's for those PPM who has their weapon model
built-in the main, tris.md2 model file.
 Just copy the weapon.md2 into each directory of the PPM and your done. No need to
look for a weapon.pcx file, as it uses the Male weapon skin.
